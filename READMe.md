# Go eBPF

![Go eBPF Logo](https://ebpf-go.dev/ebpf-go.png)

This repository is a test project designed to get familiar with eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology using the Go programming language.

## Description

eBPF technology has gained popularity in recent years due to its ability to provide a secure and efficient framework for programming in the Linux kernel. It allows developers to write small programs that run in the kernel and can intercept and modify system events in real-time, such as network traffic or system events.

This project aims to provide a starting point for those who want to explore eBPF with Go. It provides simple examples of how to write eBPF programs using Go and how to load and execute them in the kernel.

## Features

- Examples of eBPF programs written in Go.
- Utilities for loading and managing eBPF programs in the kernel from Go.

## Prerequisites

- Go installed on your system.
- Access to the Linux kernel source code (to compile and install BPF modules).

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rattle-Brain/go-ebpf.git
